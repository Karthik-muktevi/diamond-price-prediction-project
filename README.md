# diamonds
machine learning project
Worked on diamond price prediction project in which the data is preprocessed and feature engineering steps are performed.Different machine learning algorithms like randomforest,Knn and gradient
boosting were used to train the data to get the predicted price based on user input.In this web application users can enter the details of the diamond like color,carat,cut and clarity to get the price
prediction.Users also have the flexibility to select the algorithm and tune the hyperparameters and
get the accurate results.
